% The automatic relevance determination version of the polynomial
% kernel is included for completeness, but its use is generally not
% recommended.
%
%  k(x_i, x_j) = sigma2*(w*x_i'*A*x_j+b)^d
%
% The kernel parameters are sigma2 (kern.variance), w
% (kern.weightVariance), b (kern.biasVariance), A
% (kern.inputScales) a diagonal matrix of input scales and d
% (kern.degree). Only gradients of the first four are provided for
% kernel optimisation, it is assumed that polynomial degree would
% be set by hand.
%
% The kernel is not recommended as it is badly behaved when the
% w*x_i'*A*x_j + b has a magnitude greater than one.
