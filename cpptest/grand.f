      FUNCTION GRAND(N)                                                 GRA   10
C EXCEPT ON THE FIRST CALL GRAND RETURNS A
C PSEUDO-RANDOM NUMBER HAVING A GAUSSIAN (I.E.
C NORMAL) DISTRIBUTION WITH ZERO MEAN AND UNIT
C STANDARD DEVIATION.  THUS, THE DENSITY IS  F(X) =
C EXP(-0.5*X**2)/SQRT(2.0*PI). THE FIRST CALL
C INITIALIZES GRAND AND RETURNS ZERO.
C THE PARAMETER N IS DUMMY.
C GRAND CALLS A FUNCTION RAND, AND IT IS ASSUMED THAT
C SUCCESSIVE CALLS TO RAND(0) GIVE INDEPENDENT
C PSEUDO- RANDOM NUMBERS DISTRIBUTED UNIFORMLY ON (0,
C 1), POSSIBLY INCLUDING 0 (BUT NOT 1).
C THE METHOD USED WAS SUGGESTED BY VON NEUMANN, AND
C IMPROVED BY FORSYTHE, AHRENS, DIETER AND BRENT.
C ON THE AVERAGE THERE ARE 1.37746 CALLS OF RAND FOR
C EACH CALL OF GRAND.
C WARNING - DIMENSION AND DATA STATEMENTS BELOW ARE
C           MACHINE-DEPENDENT.
C DIMENSION OF D MUST BE AT LEAST THE NUMBER OF BITS
C IN THE FRACTION OF A FLOATING-POINT NUMBER.
C THUS, ON MOST MACHINES THE DATA STATEMENT BELOW
C CAN BE TRUNCATED.
C IF THE INTEGRAL OF SQRT(2.0/PI)*EXP(-0.5*X**2) FROM
C A(I) TO INFINITY IS 2**(-I), THEN D(I) = A(I) -
C A(I-1).
